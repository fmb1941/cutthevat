Introducing a reduced VAT rate for this work would be a simple and highly effective means through which to fulfil many of the UK’s major objectives in one hit.<br /> <br />  </div><div id="esctl_5209217_pnlAssetHolder" class="oAssetInline oAssetRight">

 <div class="ContentEditor"><h5>Economic growth</h5> The UK economy has started to show some signs of recovery, though there is a way to go before the construction industry and the wider economy is operating at pre-recession levels. The latest independent economic research from Experian shows that a reduction in VAT on housing renovation and repair to 5% could provide a huge economic stimulus of more than £15 billion over the five-year period from 2015 to 2020. Also successful trials in a number of other EU countries strongly suggest a cut in VAT on housing renovation and repair work would reap economic benefits for the UK.<br />

 <div class="ContentEditor">  <h5> <span lang="EN-GB">Increased employment</span></h5>  <p>
<span lang="EN-GB">Currently there are a total of 2.34 million unemployed people in the UK. This is terrible news for the Government’s finances as well as for those individuals affected. Moreover, unless the industry can recruit and train sufficient people now, there will be a serious skills shortage in future years. The latest independent economic research from Experian shows that a reduction in VAT on housing renovation and repair from 20% to 5% could create 42,000 extra full-time equivalent construction jobs from 2015 to 2020 and more still, an additional 53,000 jobs in the wider economy over the same five-year period.</span></p>

 <div class="ContentEditor"> <p>  </p> <h5>Greener homes and warmer homes</h5> Existing homes contribute around 27% of the UK’s total carbon emissions. There is a vast amount of work to be done if the UK is to meet the legally binding targets for reducing emissions by 80% by 2050. A cut in VAT on housing renovation and repair would encourage home owners to improve their homes and at the same time, improve the energy efficiency of their properties .According to research carried out by the University of East Anglia, energy efficiency work is typically carried out alongside other work, with only one in ten households considering energy-efficiency-only renovations. Therefore if we can encourage home owners to carry out general renovation work, they will be far more likely to commission energy efficiency improvements at the same time.<br />

 <div class="ContentEditor"><h5>Cost of living</h5> The cost of living is becoming an ever-increasing problem for British families, particularly in relation to energy bills. Increasing the energy efficiency of our homes is the only way we can protect ourselves from the long-term global increase in the cost of energy. Government has a responsibility to help people do this. A cut in VAT to 5% on all housing renovation and repair would allow millions of households to upgrade their homes and make them more energy efficient. Such a move would also improve take-up of the Green Deal – the Government’s existing energy-efficiency scheme – by reducing the overall cost of the work and therefore making it more attractive. A VAT reduction would also incentivise those home owners who would rather pay for the work up front. Without help to reduce energy use, the number of households living in fuel poverty will continue to grow, as people struggle to protect themselves against rising fuel prices.<br />

 <div class="ContentEditor"><h5> <span lang="EN-GB">More homes</span></h5> <span lang="EN-GB">    We are building fewer than half the number of new homes needed to match the rate of household growth in the UK. Therefore it is shocking that there were almost 640,000 homes lying empty in 2013 in England alone according to the most recent <a class="oLinkExternal" title="Empty Homes" href="http://www.emptyhomes.com/statistics-2/empty-homes-statistice-201112/">empty homes statistics</a>. Although the Government applies a reduced rate of VAT of 5% on the refurbishment of properties that have been vacant for more than two years, the much higher rate of VAT of 20% on homes that have been vacant for less than that time period results in a perverse incentive for private landlords and local authorities to leave their properties lying empty for longer than may be necessary. If the Government were to apply a reduced rate of VAT on all housing renovation and repair many of these properties would be brought back into use more rapidly and thus ease the ever-growing demand for available housing.<br />

 <div class="ContentEditor"><h5>Fewer cowboy builders</h5> Reducing VAT from 20% to 5% on the labour element of all housing renovation and repair work would also reduce the competitive advantage of the £9.76bn per annum informal economy in construction – which is a significant problem in the industry. This would help support compliance with Building Regulations, planning law, health and safety legislation, consumer protection provisions, and employment law, as well as tax collection from the sector. Again, this simple, single action to cut VAT on housing renovation and repair work to 5% would protect consumers and legitimate businesses by significantly reducing the competitive advantage of rogue traders.<br />   <br />Visit our <a class="oLinkExternal" title="Research" href="/news-publications/newsroom/campaigns/cut-the-vat/research/">research page</a> for more information. <p> </p> </div>
