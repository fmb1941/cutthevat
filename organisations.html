We are committed to new product innovation and sustainability. Our glass mineral wool is made using a high content of recycled glass; it is recyclable at the end of the building's life and can be compression packed reducing carbon emissions even further.

The list of good reasons behind the Cut the VAT campaign is so long that the SBF is continually baffled as to why the UK Government consistently refuses to put it into practice.  Eliminating the competitive advantage of the ‘cash in hand’ cowboys and driving them out the industry; Stimulating activity and supporting jobs and skills within the construction sector; Encouraging homeowners and businesses to invest in the measures needed to green our built environment and meet carbon reduction targets; Stimulating spending to increase VAT revenue to the Treasury.  These are just some of the reasons why SBF supports the Cut the VAT campaign so strongly and will continue to campaign for the rate of VAT on home repair, maintenance and improvement works to be cut to 5%.

Shawbrook’s specialist consumer lending division works with home improvement companies in the UK to provide consumer finance packages. Shawbrook has a strong appetite to lend in the home improvement market, and is focused on doing everything it can to help home improvement companies win business. Shawbrook’s systems and processes are designed specifically with home improvement companies in mind, and it is the only lender in the home improvement consumer finance market that always deals direct with its partners, and never through brokers.
<br>
<br>
Shawbrook was formed in 2011 from three existing financial businesses – Whiteaway Laidlaw Bank, Link Loans and Commercial First. In 2012 Shawbrook acquired Singers Asset Finance to expand its lending offer to SMEs.

<td width="440"><strong>The Tax Payers Alliance</strong><br>The TaxPayers’ Alliance is Britain’s independent grassroots campaign for lower taxes. After years of being ignored by politicians of all parties, the TPA is committed to forcing politicians to listen to ordinary taxpayers.
<br>
<br>
Taxes have been rising but there has been very little improvement in the quality of schools, hospitals and transport provided by government. Most recently, British workers, employers, consumers, homeowners and pensioners have been hit by higher national insurance contributions, huge council tax increases, VAT hikes, and higher taxes on pension funds.
